Baby Instructions

How to care for your baby.

## Sass
Comes from [Shoelace](https://github.com/joshdcomp/shoelace).

## Tidbits
- The `.gitignore` in this repo is meant to be used in concert with the global `.gitignore` for OSX suggested  [here]( https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global)

## Running this
This repo requires running on a LAMP stack and `/www` should be the public web root (this matches my local dev environment set up here: http://mallinson.ca/osx-web-development)
